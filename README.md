# Howdy :wave:

I'm Exr0n, and I want to build intelligent systems. I'm obsessed with efficiency, generality, and maintainability--and I'm currently focusing on honing my skills and returning to projects... someday. I'm interested in ML, algorithms, design paradigms, concurrency, and low level optimizations.

Some of my projects include:
- [Algorithms](http://tinyurl.com/yd4m55e): it will see the light someday...
- [Condution](condution.com): a holistic task management system
- [Simple Backpropogation](exr0nprojects/neural_net_cpp): a peek behind the fundamentals of current machine learning

I'm excited to (eventually) work on:
- [Touchboard](exr0nprojects/touchboard): type and gesture from your trackpad seamlessly
- [Pitaya](exr0nprojects/pitaya): a Toggl inpsired time management platform with better tags and better performance
- [Annote](exr0nproejcts/annote): an efficient, modal note taking/mind mapping workflow with inline drawings and persistent connections

You can find all my latest endevours at [github/Exr0nProjects](https://github.com/exr0nprojects)

And just for funsies:
