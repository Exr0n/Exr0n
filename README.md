# Howdy, I'm Exr0n  :wave:

**I want to build intelligent systems. I'm obsessed with efficiency, generality, and maintainability--and I'm currently focusing on honing my skills and returning to projects... someday. I'm interested in ML, algorithms, design paradigms, concurrency, and low level optimizations.**

Some of my projects include:
- [Foxstr](exr0nprojects/foxstr): thompson algorithm + aho corasick for linear multi-regex matching
- [Algorithms](https://tinyurl.com/yd4m55e): it will see the light someday...
- [TeamsCode](https://teamscode.com): inspire students to solve problems using CS
- [Condution](https://condution.com): a holistic task management system
- [Simple Neural Net](exr0nprojects/neural_net_cpp): a peek behind the fundamentals of current machine learning

I'm excited to (eventually) work on:
- [Touchboard](exr0nprojects/touchboard): type and gesture from your trackpad seamlessly
- [Turnup](exr0nprojects/turnup): quantified self-esq data tracking and visualization scripts
- [Pitaya](exr0nprojects/pitaya): a Toggl inpsired time management platform with better tags and better performance
- [Annote](exr0nprojects/annote): an efficient, modal note taking/mind mapping workflow with inline drawings and persistent connections
- [Generalized iStats.widget](exr0nprojects/istats.widget): a generalization of the iStats.widget for Ubersicht with colors and an API
